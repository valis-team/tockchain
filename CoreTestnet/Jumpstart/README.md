This folder contains the jumpstart files (e.g., jumpstart.zip) required to resume Tockchain Core Testnets using the jumpstart method.

These files are specifically needed for validators to continue operations from a previous Core Testnet state, preserving the existing genesis block when the resumption is successful. Generators do not require these files and can be started at any time.
