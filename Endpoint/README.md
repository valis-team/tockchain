This folder contains the files required to set up a WebSocket-enabled API endpoint for the Tockchain network. Using websocketd, multiple endpoints can be created to handle real-time communication. Each connection spawns a new process that processes WebSocket requests, routing them to the appropriate services. This enables seamless interaction with the network via the console, WebSocket clients, or UI integrations.
